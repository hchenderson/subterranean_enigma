/**
 * Core Philosophy: This ruleset enforces a strict user-ownership model that segregates administrative users from game participants. All data is private by default, and a user (whether an admin or participant) can only access documents that are directly associated with their unique user ID (UID).
 *
 * Data Structure: The data is organized into three primary top-level collections: `/admins` for administrators, `/games` for game-specific data like hints and materials, and `/participants` for game players. A participant's game progress is stored in a nested subcollection, `/participants/{participantId}/gameState`, ensuring that all of a user's data is contained within a single, securable data tree.
 *
 * Key Security Decisions:
 * - Strict Segregation: Admins and Participants are stored in separate collections to prevent any overlap in access rules.
 * - Ownership-Based Access: All rules for participant data are based on the principle that the authenticated user's UID must match the document ID in the path (e.g., `{participantId}`).
 * - Admin Access to Game Data: Authenticated, non-anonymous users (admins) have full access to the `/games` collection, which is necessary for them to manage game content like hints and materials.
 * - Joinable Games Logic: Unauthenticated users are permitted to query the `participants` collection group *only if* the parent game document has a flag `isJoinable == true`. This is a critical security gate for the login flow.
 * - Default Deny: Access is denied by default. All permissions must be explicitly granted.
 *
 * Denormalization for Authorization: The structure `/participants/{participantId}/gameState` uses the path itself as the primary authorization mechanism. This avoids the need for costly `get()` calls to a parent document when securing the `gameState` subcollection.
